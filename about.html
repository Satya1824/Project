				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<h5><em>We Light India.</em></h5>
				<p>We are the third largest producer of electricity in the world. The national electric grid in India has an installed capacity of 
					393.389 GW as of 31 December 2021. Renewable power plants, which also include large hydroelectric plants, constitute 37% of India's 
					total installed capacity. During the fiscal year (FY) 2019-20, the gross electricity generated by utilities in India was 1,383.5 TWh 
					and the total electricity generation (utilities and non-utilities) in the country was 1,598 TWh. The gross electricity consumption in 
					FY2019 was 1,208 kWh per capita. In FY2015, electric energy consumption in agriculture was recorded as being the highest (17.89%) 
					worldwide. The per capita electricity consumption is low compared to most other countries despite India having a low electricity 
					tariff. India has a surplus power generation capacity but lacks adequate fuel supply, transmission and distribution infrastructure. 
					The average plant load factor of the thermal power plants is below 60% against the norm of 85%. India's electricity sector is 
					dominated by fossil fuels, in particular coal, which produced about three-quarters of the country's electricity. The government 
					is making efforts to increase investment in renewable energy. The government's National Electricity Plan of 2018 states that the 
					country does not need more non-renewable power plants in the utility sector until 2027, with the commissioning of 50,025 MW coal-
					based power plants under construction and addition of 275,000 MW total renewable power capacity after the retirement of nearly 48,000 
					MW old coal-fired plants. It is expected that non-fossil fuels generation contribution is likely to be around 44.7% of the total gross 
					electricity generation by 2029-30.</p>
